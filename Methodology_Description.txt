# Methodology:


Please, use  Sklearn to implement the below-mentioned algorithms in the form of a Python script.

- Jupyter notebooks are NOT accepted as final implementations. 

- If you are interested, you can consult my recent python package for detecting dyslexia (DD) to shape the structure of your project and create your test beds:

DD repo: https://github.com/Sorooshi/DD


Please:

- provide a list of features not less than 10 and no more than 30 from https://librosa.org/doc/latest/feature.html;

- provide a brief description of each;




Methods to implement:

1) K-Means
2) GMM
3) Spectral  
4) Agglomerative
5) you propose
6) you propose


# Experimental setting:


- Tune the parameters using Bayesian Search Optimization or Grid Search (will discuss it later) in a five-fold-cross validation framework. 

- For each method:

    step1: use 10 seed random initializations, select the best results w.r.t NMI (or ARI); 
    step 2: repeat step 1 for 10 times;
    step 3: report compute mean and std of the metric(s) under consideration.
    
    
Note: This is a part of our plan which we discussed in our meeting on Thursday, 10 November 2022.
